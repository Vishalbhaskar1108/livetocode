In this project I made a website for Cab allocation named as Lavi Cans in which there are 3 modules. The modules are for Admin, driver and customer. The admin can manipulate the cabs. Then, as a customer one can check the availability of a vehicle and thus book it. As a server he can give information to database when he is booked (and the place to which he is going) or when he reaches back after finishing a task. The driver is responsible to feed the data when he completes a task. Therefore, we would be able to solve the problem of non availability and improper management of car.  
In the zip folder, you can find various pictures, fonts, PHP, HTML files and a mysql database file. Import the database and run the home page on the local server.
The lavicabs report file which is a doc file gives the brief about the functionality of the project and screenshots show it in action.
